# Windows Notification System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Problem
The desktop application notifications were not working on Windows:
1. App not appearing in Windows notification settings
2. App identity showing as "Windows WebView2 Manager" instead of "HabitQuest"
3. Test notification button not functioning
4. Background notifications not being delivered

### Root Causes Found

#### 1. Missing Notification Plugin Configuration
**File:** `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- **Issue:** No plugins configuration section existed
- **Fix:** Added proper notification plugin configuration:
```json
"plugins": {
  "notification": {
    "default": ["all"]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Incomplete Notification Backend Implementation
**File:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- **Issue:** Custom `tauri_send_notification` command only logged messages instead of sending real notifications
- **Fix:** Updated to use proper Tauri notification plugin API:
```rust
use tauri_plugin_notification::NotificationExt;

let mut builder = app_handle.notification().builder()
  .title(&title)
  .body(&body);
  
if let Some(icon_name) = icon {
  builder = builder.icon(&icon_name);
}

builder.show()?;
```

#### 3. App Identity Configuration
**File:** `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- **Status:** Already properly configured as `"com.renkaistudios.habitquest"`
- **Note:** This should prevent the "WebView2 Manager" identity issue

### Dependencies Verified
- ✅ `tauri-plugin-notification = "2"` present in `Cargo.toml`
- ✅ Plugin initialization in `lib.rs`: `.plugin(tauri_plugin_notification::init())`
- ✅ Custom commands properly registered in `invoke_handler`

### Testing Steps
After building and running the new version:

1. **Test Notification Button:**
   - Open Settings → Notifications
   - Click "Test Notification" button
   - Should display a proper Windows notification

2. **Windows System Integration:**
   - Check Windows Settings → System → Notifications & actions
   - Look for "HabitQuest" in the application list
   - Should appear with proper app name and icon

3. **Background Notifications:**
   - Enable background notifications in app settings
   - Close the application
   - Should receive habit reminder notifications after configured intervals

### Expected Behavior
- App should appear in Windows notification settings as "HabitQuest"
- Test notifications should work immediately
- Background service should send proper Windows notifications
- App identity should be preserved across notification interactions

### Build Status
Building with updated notification system...
